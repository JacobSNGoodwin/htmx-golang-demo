# TODOS

- [ ] - Make challenges table
  - [ ] - id field (maybe just a UUID/ULID, doesn't matter much)
  - [ ] - title (make this full-text searchable)
  - [ ] - categories/tags (make this full-text searchable array to search items in array)
    - might not use this initially, but could be good for future filtering and building of lists
  - [ ] - prompt type
  - [ ] - prompt_details- probably a JSON type object because different types of challenges would have different prompt and responses
